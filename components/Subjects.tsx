They wrote speeches and presentations that they later delivered to live audiences, and crafted works of various lengths and genres submitted as part of curricular projects. 

      I see the writing process as the management of five distinct steps and teach my students to see writing as an active process: active thinking, active research, active distillation, active flow of words, and active revision. My approach is not to review a student's work but to actively engage the student in conversation, in simultaneous writing, and revision.`,

        Over the years my students and I have read and discussed: the history of the Roman Empire with a focus on the life of Augustus Cesar, the Revolutionary War and the Constitutional Convention, the Age of Jackson, the history of the Transcontinental Railroad, the Industrialization of Japan and the creation of the Japanese Colonial Empire, World War I on the Western and Eastern Front, Stalinism, and the building and destruction of the Berlin Wall.

        Each of my courses is bespoke and tailored specifically to a student's specific interests. The student and I work in tandem: we choose a topic and era to explore, select the books we will read, and set the pace and goals of the course. Most often, we read college-level books and meet weekly to review chapters.

        Some of my students also choose to write papers and books. My most advanced student, a 15-year-old, is at present completing his masterful 100+ page book on the Battles of the Napoleonic Wars.`,

We meet regularly, and together we guide the overflowing imaginative text through critical sluices into lakes of beauty where we prepare it for publication.

      The second type of writer loves literature and appreciates the craft of weaving words into tapestries of meaning. My goal is to expose such writers to works of literature that we read together, dissect them for content, structure, phrasing, and melody, and thereby ignite the students' desire and will to write their own narrative.`,

      My goal is to guide students on a journey of understanding what it meant to live life fully in the Ancient World and what it means to live a life fully in the present era. It is a journey of close reading, reflection, interpretation, and deep discussion. I am looking for students who would like to join us.`,
